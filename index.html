        Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12,
        2009)[3] was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
        contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed
        the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work,
        including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and
        the Congressional Gold Medal. Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in
        1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of
        Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position in
        Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant
        wheat varieties.[1][2] During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the
        introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern
        agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a
        result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and
        1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly
        improving the food security in those nations.[4] Borlaug was often
        called "the father of the Green Revolution",[5][6] and is credited with
        saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.[7][8][9][10]
        According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the
        World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg
        Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The
        article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may
        have prevented a billion deaths."[11] He was awarded the Nobel Peace
        Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through
        increasing food supply. Later in his life, he helped apply these methods
        of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.[12]
